# OpenAI Cocktail Recipes Generator 

This is an example app for generating cocktail recipes by name. You may try both well-known cocktail names or try to invent your own.
This app is based on the [pet name generator app](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python) used in the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-cocktails
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment

   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

8. Run the app

   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)! For the full context behind this example app, check out the [tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).
